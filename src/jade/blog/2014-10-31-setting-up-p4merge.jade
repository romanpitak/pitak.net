    Sadly, no Sourcetree for Linux. Console it is. Not for merging though. P4Merge.

    ## P4Merge

    [Download P4Merge](http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User?qt-perforce_downloads_step_3=1#product-10),
    extract the archive and create a link (somewhere in your $PATH).

    ```bash
    sudo tar \
        --no-same-owner \
        --extract --ungzip \
        --file ~/Downloads/p4v.tgz \
        --directory /opt
    sudo ln \
        --symbolic \
        /opt/p4v-2014.2.951414/bin/p4merge \
        /usr/bin/p4merge
    ```

    `--no-same-owner` ensures the files are owned by the current user (root) and not by whomever created the original archive.

    `--directory /opt` sets the destination (installation) directory for p4v.

    ## Mergetool

    Edit your `~/.gitconfig` file:

    ```
    [merge]
            tool = p4merge
    [mergetool "p4merge"]
            cmd = p4merge "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"
            trustExitCode = true
    ```

    ## Difftool

    Edit your `~/.gitconfig` file:

    ```
    [diff]
            tool = p4merge
    [difftool "p4merge"]
            cmd = p4merge "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"
    ```

    ## Nice to have

    This has nothing to do with p4merge, but it makes the `git mergetool` and `git difftool` commands a bit more usable from the console by not asking stupid questions and creating sissy backup files.

    Edit your `~/.gitconfig` file:

    ```text
    [mergetool]
            prompt = false
            keepBackup = false
            keepTemporaries = false
    [difftool]
            prompt = false
    ```
